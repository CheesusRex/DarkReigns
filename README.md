# DarkReigns
A 2D platforming game created in Unity


Dark Reigns Idea/ToDo List

Idea:Platformer Game that revolves around collecting weapons/items and using boss fights to create even better items

Ideas
--------------------
-Weapon Degredatiion

-Procedural Generation (40 or so Spelunky themed tiles)

-Boss is summoned with certain components on the map, along with player items place into it

-"Boss Crafting" depending on items placed into summoning chamber

-Better items/more items of type placed in, higher chance of type of item/quality

-URGENCY: Done with weapons degrading over time and/or monsters outright stop dropping weapons

-Endless inventory?

-VISIBLE PLAYER, but still recognizable in a swarm.

-Use of Diskel/pixel art. 

-Demonic/Satanic theme

-"Glorify" an item for another playthrough.

-COOP!


TODO:
-----------------
-Create a basic, 2d room to test movement of player

-Make player controls feel fun. Think about making ladders?

-Make Tilemap random generation with more options

-Make Tilemap prefab generator for editor. These will be addable to the main tilemap generator for specific sections of the level (eg. spawn, end point, secrets, etc.)

-Create detailed story (this will help for art direction and designing levels/enemies)

-Design enemies

-Design characters/items (will we have multiple characters with different skills? or are the skills tied to items? explore ideas for this)
